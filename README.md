# Los Angeles Crime Data Analysis using Apache Spark & Hadoop

This project was developed as part of the **Advanced Topics in Databases** course at **NTUA, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering**. It involves analyzing large-scale crime datasets from Los Angeles using **Apache Spark (≥3.5)** and **Apache Hadoop (≥3.0)** in a distributed AWS environment.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Distributed Data Processing**: Implementation of Spark DataFrame and RDD APIs for query execution.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Utilized Apache Sedona for spatial queries related to crime incidents and police station proximity.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Compared execution times across different Spark APIs (DataFrame vs. SQL) and storage formats (CSV vs. Parquet).
- **Cluster Optimization**: Tested different resource allocation strategies using Spark executors and memory configurations.
- **Crime Insights**: Analyzed trends such as:
  - Crime rates by demographic
  - Police station efficiency
  - Crime-to-income correlations

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Apache Spark** (DataFrame & SQL APIs)
- **Apache Hadoop**
- **Apache Sedona** (for geospatial processing)
- **AWS S3** (for data storage)
- **Parquet** (optimized data storage format)

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes:

- **Los Angeles Crime Data (2010-present)**
- **Census Blocks (2010)**
- **Household Income (2015)**
- **LAPD Station Locations**
